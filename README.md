# The Journalism Library

A collection of helper functions written in TypeScrit for journalistic projects.

The library is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/journalism). To install, run `npm i journalism` in your terminal.

The documentation can be found [here](https://nshiab.github.io/journalism/).

If you wish to contribute, create an issue explaining what you would like to add, create a branch from the issue, make sure to add tests, import your function in index.ts and then create a pull request. To run a specific test, you can use a command like this one `npx mocha --require ts-node/register ./test/finance/adjustToInflation.test.ts`. To run all tests, including building the library and generating the docs (in ./test-docs), run `npm run all-tests`.
