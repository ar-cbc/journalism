# The Journalism Library

A collection of TypeScript functions for journalistic projects.

The library is available on [JSR](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism) with its
[documentation](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism/doc).

The library is maintained by [Nael Shiab](http://naelshiab.com/), computational
journalist and senior data producer for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news).
